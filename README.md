# Purse_Project

The Purse.java file is creating a new class called "purse" where the items such as coins in the purse are stored in an ArrayList. This code has prewritten elements to outline the code and show what methods were necessary to complete the assignment. The method's contents were empty and I had to write the code for what each method was supposed to do.

The PurseTester.java was a supplemental file that was written by my professor to test the Purse.java file and each of its methods that I have coded. to test my code for Purse.java I insist that PurseTester.java must be used.
